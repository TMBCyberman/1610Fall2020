I need to remember how to commit
Why are we still here?
Just to suffer?
Anyway Professor Romrell if you can see this have a nice day
Or maybe you prefer Anthony?
Anyway, if you see this message me what you prefer
PS I want to get to know you as a person better (like your interests, hoobies, and such) so maybe we chat like this
I ask you about yourself or share my interests and such or just plain chat thorugh commits and you respond with canvas messages and whatnot
Unless you know it wouldn't work
Anyway, let me know
Can't commit Sunday because can't use computers sunday (policy of the house)
So here's 2 lines to make up for it
Dang college is hard
Lots of work
And even when I think I'm ahead, I'm really not
The new homework this week has me so confosed
Hopefully I can get everything done and understand stuff
I can't get into unity, but I'll keep committing here
Still committing
