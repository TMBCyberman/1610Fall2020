I need to remember how to commit
Why are we still here?
Just to suffer?
Anyway Professor Romrell if you can see this have a nice day
Or maybe you prefer Anthony?
Anyway, if you see this message me what you prefer
PS I want to get to know you as a person better (like your interests, hoobies, and such) so maybe we chat like this
I ask you about yourself or share my interests and such or just plain chat thorugh commits and you respond with canvas messages and whatnot
Unless you know it wouldn't work
Anyway, let me know
